# What is Unit Testing

**UNIT TESTING** is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.

## Why Unit Testing?

1. Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs.
2. It helps the developers to understand the testing code base and enables them to make changes quickly
3. Good unit tests serve as project documentation
4. Unit tests help with code re-use. Migrate both your code and your tests to your new project. Tweak the code until the tests run again.

## How to do Unit Testing

In order to do Unit Testing, developers write a section of code to test a specific function in software application. Developers can also isolate this function to test more rigorously which reveals unnecessary dependencies between function being tested and other units so the dependencies can be eliminated. Developers generally use UnitTest framework to develop automated test cases for unit testing.

Unit Testing is of two types

- Manual
- Automated

Unit testing is commonly automated but may still be performed manually. Software Engineering does not favor one over the other but automation is preferred. A manual approach to unit testing may employ a step-by-step instructional document.

Under the automated approach-

- A developer writes a section of code in the application just to test the function. They would later comment out and finally remove the test code when the application is deployed.
- A developer could also isolate the function to test it more rigorously. This is a more thorough unit testing practice that involves copy and paste of code to its own testing environment than its natural environment. Isolating the code helps in revealing unnecessary dependencies between the code being tested and other units or data spaces in the product. These dependencies can then be eliminated.
- A coder generally uses a UnitTest Framework to develop automated test cases. Using an automation framework, the developer codes criteria into the test to verify the correctness of the code. During execution of the test cases, the framework logs failing test cases. Many frameworks will also automatically flag and report, in summary, these failed test cases. Depending on the severity of a failure, the framework may halt subsequent testing.
- The workflow of Unit Testing is
  - Create Test Cases
  - Review/Rework
  - Baseline
  - Execute Test Cases.

## Unit Testing Tools (Java)

There are several automated unit test software available to assist with unit testing. I will provide an example below

- [Junit](https://junit.org/junit5/): Junit is a free to use testing tool used for Java programming language.  It provides assertions to identify test method. This tool test data first and then inserted in the piece of code.

## Test Driven Development (TDD) & Unit Testing

Unit testing in TDD involves an extensive use of testing frameworks. A unit test framework is used in order to create automated unit tests. Unit testing frameworks are not unique to TDD, but they are essential to it. Below we look at some of what TDD brings to the world of unit testing:

- Tests are written before the code
- Rely heavily on testing frameworks
- All classes in the applications are tested
- Quick and easy integration is made possible

## Unit Testing Advantage

- Developers looking to learn what functionality is provided by a unit and how to use it can look at the unit tests to gain a basic understanding of the unit API.
- Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code at a later date, and make sure the module still works correctly (i.e. Regression testing). The procedure is to write test cases for all functions and methods so that whenever a change causes a fault, it can be quickly identified and fixed.
- Due to the modular nature of the unit testing, we can test parts of the project without waiting for others to be completed.

## Unit Testing Disadvantages

- Unit testing can't be expected to catch every error in a program. It is not possible to evaluate all execution paths even in the most trivial programs
Unit testing by its very nature focuses on a unit of code. Hence it canâ€™t catch integration errors or broad system level errors.
- It's recommended unit testing be used in conjunction with other testing activities.

## Unit Testing Best Practices

- Unit Test cases should be independent. In case of any enhancements or change in requirements, unit test cases should not be affected.
- Test only one code at a time.
- Follow clear and consistent naming conventions for your unit tests.
- In case of a change in code in any module, ensure there is a corresponding unit Test Case for the module, and the module passes the tests before changing the implementation.
- Bugs identified during unit testing must be fixed before proceeding to the next phase in SDLC.
- Adopt a "test as your code" approach. The more code you write without testing, the more paths you have to check for errors.

## Summary

- **UNIT TESTING** is defined as a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested.
- As you can see, there can be a lot involved in unit testing. It can be complex or rather simple depending on the application being tested and the testing strategies, tools and philosophies used. Unit testing is always necessary on some level. That is a certainty.
